      "full": "Phantom ships are spectral vessels reported by mariners throughout history, appearing as ghostly ships that materialize and vanish at sea. The most famous is the **Flying Dutchman**, a legendary Dutch East India Company ship cursed to sail the oceans forever after its captain defied God or a storm. These ships typically appear **glowing or translucent**, often before storms, and are considered **death omens** in maritime superstition. Other famous examples include the **Mary Celeste** (a real abandoned ship whose mystery persists), the **SS Ourang Medan**, and the **Lady Lovibond**. Numerous sightings have been reported over centuries, including a claimed sighting by **King George V in 1881**. Scientific explanations include optical illusions such as **Fata Morgana mirages**, which can create ship-like images in the sky. Phantom ships remain a cornerstone of maritime folklore and appear prominently in nautical literature and popular culture, including *Pirates of the Caribbean*."
