      "full": "Phantom ships are spectral vessels reported by mariners throughout history, appearing as ghostly ships that materialize and vanish at sea. The most famous is the Flying Dutchman, a legendary Dutch East India Company ship cursed to sail the oceans forever after its captain defied God or a storm. These ships typically appear glowing or translucent, often before storms, and are considered death omens in maritime superstition. Other famous examples include the Mary Celeste (a real abandoned ship whose mystery persists), the SS Ourang Medan, and the Lady Lovibond. Numerous sightings have been reported over centuries, including a claimed sighting by King George V in 1881. Scientific explanations include optical illusions such as Fata Morgana mirages, which can create ship-like images in the sky. Phantom ships remain a cornerstone of maritime folklore and appear prominently in nautical literature and popular culture, including Pirates of the Caribbean."
